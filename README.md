# Object-Oriented Programming in C++

This repository is a structured learning resource for understanding  
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++** from **basic concepts to advanced usage**.

The goal of this repository is to provide:
- clear explanations
- real-world understanding
- practical C++ examples
- a smooth learning path from beginner to advanced level

Each topic is organized in its **own folder** with focused documentation and code examples.

##  Learning Roadmap

The repository follows a progressive roadmap.  
You are encouraged to study the topics **in order**.

### Foundations

- [Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming](02_Procedural_vs_Object_Oriented_Programming/README.md)

---

### Core Object-Oriented Concepts

- [Classes & Objects](03_Classes_and_Objects/README.md)
- [Data Members & Member Functions](04_Data_Members_and_Member_Functions/README.md)
- [Access Specifiers & Encapsulation](05_Access_Specifiers_and_Encapsulation/README.md)
- [Abstraction](06_Abstraction/README.md)

---

### Object Construction & Class Behavior

- [Constructors & Destructors](07_Constructors_and_Destructors/README.md)
- [`this` Pointer](08_this_Pointer/README.md)
- [Static Members](09_Static_Members/README.md)

---

### Object Relationships

- [Inheritance](10_Inheritance/README.md)
- [Types of Inheritance](11_Types_of_Inheritance/README.md)
- [Association](12_Association/README.md)
- [Aggregation](13_Aggregation/README.md)
- [Composition](14_Composition/README.md)

---

### Polymorphism

- [Operator Overloading](16_Operator_Overloading/README.md)
- [Virtual Functions](17_Virtual_Functions/README.md)
- [Runtime Polymorphism](18_Runtime_Polymorphism/README.md)

---

### Practical & Advanced Topics

- [File Handling with OOP](19_File_Handling_with_OOP/README.md)
- [Templates (Introduction)](20_Templates/README.md)
- [Exception Handling](21_Exception_Handling/README.md)

---

## Folder Structure

Each topic folder generally contains:

- `README.md` → concept explanation  
- `example.cpp` → practical C++ example  
- `practice.md` → practice questions (where applicable)

This keeps learning **focused and organized**.

---

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start from the **Introduction**
2. Move forward step by step
3. Read the explanation
4. Run and modify the C++ examples
5. Practice the questions

Do not skip topics unless you already understand them.

---

## Learning Philosophy

- Focus on **understanding**, not memorization  
- Prefer **clarity over complexity**  
- Learn concepts first, then syntax  
- Keep examples simple and realistic

## Contributions

This repository is open for learning and improvement.  
Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.
